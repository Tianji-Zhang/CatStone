  <doc-data|<doc-title|A Problem with Upwind Scheme>>

  <\example>
    The basic upwind scheme for flux in hyperbolic transport problem
  </example>

  For a species transport equation

  <math|C<rsub|i><rsup|n+1>=C<rsub|i><rsup|
  n>-<around*|[|F<rsub|l<around*|(|i|)>>-F<rsub|r<around*|(|i|)>>|]>>

  Actually,

  <math|F<rsub|l<around*|(|i|)>>=<around*|{|<tabular|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|u
  <rsub|l<around*|(|i|)>>C<rsub|i-1>>|<cell|if>|<cell|u<rsub|l<around*|(|i|)>>\<gtr\>0>>|<row|<cell|u
  <rsub|l<around*|(|i|)>>C<rsub|i>>|<cell|if>|<cell|u<rsub|l<around*|(|i|)>>\<less\>0>>>>>|\<nobracket\>>>

  <math|u<rsub|l<around*|(|i|)>>=<frac|1|2><around*|(|u<rsub|i-1>+u<rsub|i>|)>>

  So, what is the strict definition of <math|l>?

  <\example>
    The second-order upwind scheme for flux in a black-oil model \ 
  </example>

  <math|T<rsub|l<around*|(|i|)>>=<around*|\<nobracket\>|<frac|A|\<Delta\>x>
  <frac|k|\<mu\>>|\|><rsub|l<around*|(|i|)>>>

  The original index is <math|i-<frac|1|2>> but for the purpose of robustness
  we change it in the form of a function.

  We still could not figure out what the index really means, because

  <math|A<rsub|l<around*|(|i|)>>=A<rsub|i-1>=A<rsub|i+1>>

  <math|\<Delta\>x<rsub|l<around*|(|i|)>>=<around*|\||x<rsub|i>-x<rsub|x-1>|\|>>

  <math|\<mu\><rsub|l<around*|(|i|)>>=<frac|1|2><around*|(|\<mu\><rsub|i-1>+\<mu\><rsub|i>|)>>

  <math|k<rsub|l<around*|(|i|)>>=<around*|{|<tabular|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|k<rsub|i-1>+k<rsub|i-2>-k<rsub|i>>|<cell|if>|<cell|p<rsub|i>\<less\>p<rsub|i-1>>>|<row|<cell|k<rsub|i>+k<rsub|i-2>-k<rsub|i-1>>|<cell|if>|<cell|p<rsub|i>\<gtr\>p<rsub|i-1>>>>>>|\<nobracket\>>>

  So, the <math|l> is actually a very complex function, it should be formally
  defined as

  <\scm>
    (define (l i target-variable control-variable upwd_scheme BCs))
  </scm>

  The variables are arrays. Generally, <math|l> could be defined as an array
  of functions with diffent index i. In this case, boundary conditions can be
  also implemented with more convenience.

  The B.C. is actually a special case, where the function returns something
  also based on the actual geometry and user setups on the specially-used
  discretize scheme.

  <section*|Recommendation>

  I suggest to use a relation data structure based on index. \ All the
  symbols in the system should be classified into two levels:

  <strong|1. Independent Unknowns>: the variables we need to solve.

  <strong|2. Intermediate Coefficients>: the coefficients we need to evaluate
  in the non-linear system, such as flux and relative permeability, defined
  by users and required by the original equations.

  3. <strong|Evaluation Terms>: the symbols finally appear and are evaluated
  in the linear equations that calculate and update the unknowns. They need
  to be defined as well.\ 

  All the terms should be able to be visited by their index of each cell

  <big-table|<tabular|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|i>|<cell|1>|<cell|2>|<cell|3>|<cell|...>>|<row|<cell|<math|C<rsub|i><rsup|n>>>|<cell|1>|<cell|1>|<cell|1>|<cell|...>>|<row|<cell|<math|F<rsub|l<around*|(|i|)>><rsup|n>>>|<cell|0>|<cell|-1>|<cell|-1>|<cell|...>>|<row|<cell|<math|F<rsub|r<around*|(|i|)>><rsup|n>>>|<cell|1>|<cell|1>|<cell|1>|<cell|...>>|<row|<cell|const>|<cell|0>|<cell|0>|<cell|0>|<cell|...>>>>>|Coefficients
  of evaluation terms in example 1. For example 2, three such tables are
  required for each phase equation (oil, water and gas).>

  There should also be another table specify how the evaluation terms are
  defined by the independent unknowns, intermeadiate coefficients, location
  index, BC and\ 

  <big-table|<tabular|<tformat|<table|<row|<cell|>>|<row|<cell|>>>>>|Intermediate
  functions in each cell.>

  For small system, automatic derivation is possible, but for larger system
  it should be a difficult task without human intervention, especially
  sufficient definition on the logical flow.
